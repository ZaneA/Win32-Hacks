A relatively small hack to enable the use of simple gestures in Windows Explorer, inspired by Thunar on Linux.
To use, just run explorergestures.exe.

Now you can:
middle click + drag up to go up a directory
middle click + drag left to go back
middle click + drag right to go forward
middle click + drag down to delete file
